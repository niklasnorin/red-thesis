Emulation of hardware
=====================
Run application in an emulated environment
QEMU
Open Source Machine Emulator
Emulates an ARM environment on any x86-64 Linux host
Full system emulation - entire OS + Applications run in emulator
User-mode emulation - only application run in emulator

Local Development - Local emulation
-----------------------------------
Full system ARM emulation
Status:
Same challenges as Local Environment - Remote Target in

Local Development - Remote emulation
------------------------------------
Might not make a lot of sense?

Cloud Development - Cloud emulation
-----------------------------------
Same QEMU environment as local emulation
Status:
Same challenges as Local Environment - Remote Target in
