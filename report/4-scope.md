Scope
=====
This thesis will only look into embedded software built on top of the Linux kernel.

Because of the widespread use of the ARM architecture in embedded software, this will also be of focus.

The instrumentation and hardware emulation in this thesis focuses on digital emulation of signals and communication channels. It does not aim to accurately emulate analogue signals or physical models.
