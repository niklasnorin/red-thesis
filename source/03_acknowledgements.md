# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is for acknowledging all of the people who helped out -->

I would like to extend a big thank you to my examiner Anna Lombardi and my supervisor Qin-Zhong Ye, both who have let me reinvent this thesis at least three times while it was in the making.

Thanks to Tom Pollard for the report template system that enabled me to write this thesis (mostly) in Markdown [@thesis-template].

Last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank my always supporting and infinitely patient wife, Jeanna Copley, for always pushing me to be better, and to finish this thesis.
