Planning document for Master Thesis
===================================

Purpose of the thesis
---------------------
Working with embedded software development traditionally means having the physical hardware connected to a PC, often in the form of a development kit. This thesis, "An architecture for remote embedded software development", sets out to create a combined software and hardware architecture that enabled remote software development on embedded targets.

Some of the questions that this thesis set out to answer are
1. What is the basic functionality needed by embedded software developers to work with remote targets? 
2. Is it possible to create an architecture that is generic enough to be able to program, debug and run code on most embedded targets remotely?
3. What would be the limitations for the software developer working remotely compared to having physical access to the target?

*What's your angle on answering them and what are the limits of scope*
