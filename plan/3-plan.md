Purpose of the thesis
---------------------
Working with embedded software development traditionally means having access to the physical hardware, often in the form of a development kit connected to a PC. This thesis, "Emulating hardware peripherals in Linux", sets out to define and, in part, implement a software architecture that enables embedded software developers to develop, debug and test embedded software in an emulated environment.

Some of the questions that this thesis sets out to answer are

1. Is it possible to set up an environment which allows an embedded software developer to perform most development related tasks without access to the physical hardware?
2. Is it possible to do this is such an unobtrusive way, that the exact same program executable can be run both on the real hardware target and in the emulation environment?
3. Is it possible that presenting outputs and stimulating inputs in such an environment in ways not even possible with real hardware?
4. What are the main limitations of such an emulated software environment?

Time plan
---------
The total time plan is to write the thesis in about 20 week. This does not include any time to prepare for dissertation presentation or defence.

The plan is to start with some planning and structural work before diving into researching and writing the theory chapters.
