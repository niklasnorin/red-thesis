Aim of this thesis
------------------
Working with embedded software development traditionally means having access to the physical hardware, often in the form of a development kit connected to a PC. This thesis sets out to define and, in part, implement a software architecture that enables embedded software developers to develop, debug and test embedded software in an emulated environment, without access to hardware.

Some of the questions that this thesis sets out to answer are:

1. Is it possible to set up an environment which allows an embedded software developer to perform most development related tasks without access to the physical hardware?
2. Is it possible to do this is such an unobtrusive way, that the exact same program executable can be run both on the real hardware target and in the emulation environment?
3. Is it possible to present outputs and stimulate inputs in such an environment in ways not even possible with real hardware?
4. What are the main limitations of such an emulated software environment?
